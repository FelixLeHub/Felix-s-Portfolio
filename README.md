# Felix's Analysis Portfolio

### Portfolio Project 1: Hotel Dashboard
##### SQL, Power BI

Dataset: Hotel_Revenue.xlsx

Question Objectives
1. Is revenue growing year by year?
2. Should the parking lot space be increased?

### Portfolio Project 2: Customer Segmentation
##### Python

**Code:** [Customer_Segmentation.ipynb](Customer_Segmentation.ipynb)

**Data:** [Mall_Customers.csv](Mall_Customers.csv)

**Objective:** Identify the most important shopping group based on age, income, and shopping score to assist the marketing team in forming a marketing strategy.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of mall customers. The dataset contains columns for CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. This project involved loading the CSV file in Python to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using histograms, KDE plots, box plots, and scatter plots. Then, using KMean algorithm, I perform cluster analysis for univariate, bivariate, and multivariate variables to complete the objective. Creating summary statistics and visuals to identify the details of each cluster.

**Skills:** Exploratory Data Analysis, KMean Algorithm, Cluster Analysis (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate clusters)

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SKlearn

**Results: **
- Identified the most important cluster being the one with **high annual income and high spending scores**. This cluster has a **female majority**, meaning the marketing campaign should target products popular to this demographic to attract them.
- There is also an opportunity to market popular products on sale for the cluster with low annual income but high spending score.
