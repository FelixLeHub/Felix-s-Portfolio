## Portfolio Projects

### Portfolio Project 1: Hotel Power BI Dashboard

**Skills:** Data Visualization, Dashboards

**Tools:** Power BI, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

**Code:** 
- SQL: HotelRevenue_Dataset.sql
- Dashboard: HotelRevenue_Dashboard.png

**Dataset:** Revenue_History.xlsx

**Description:** This project is focused on analyzing and visualizing a dataset of hotel revenue over the years. It involved importing the dataset into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to create the data warehouse that I would link to Power BI. With Power BI, I created dashboards that tell the story of the hotel's revenue over the years.

**Objective:** Develop a database to analyze and visualize hotel booking data to answer the following questions:
  1. Is revenue growing year by year?
  2. Should the parking lot space be increased?
  3. What trends can be seen from the data?

**Process:**
- Prepare the data table for dashboard creation via Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
- Import and create necessary dashboards to complete object

**Results:** The dashboard reveals that revenue was increasing year by year, except in 2020 because the year hasn't ended yet. Although there is a trend indicating car space usage going up, the year to year increase are gradual and the hotel won't need to increase the parking space.

### Portfolio Project 2: KMeans Cluster Analysis to Segment Mall Customers For Targeted Marketing Campaign

**Skills:** Exploratory Data Analysis, KMeans Algorithm, Cluster Analysis (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate clusters)

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SKlearn

**Code:** [Customer_Segmentation.ipynb](Customer_Segmentation.ipynb)

**Dataset:** [Mall_Customers.csv](Mall_Customers.csv)

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of mall customers. The dataset contains columns for CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. This project involved loading the CSV file in Python to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using histograms, KDE plots, box plots, and scatter plots. Then, using KMean algorithm, I perform cluster analysis for univariate, bivariate, and multivariate variables to complete the objective. Creating summary statistics and visuals to identify the details of each cluster.

**Objective:** Identify the most important shopping group based on age, income, and shopping score to assist the marketing team in forming a marketing strategy.

**Process:**
- Determine cluster analysis is required to achieve objective
- Import required python library to complete analysis
- Perform analysis to derive insights.
  
**Results:**
- Identified the most important cluster being the one with **high annual income and high spending scores**. This cluster has a **female majority**, meaning the marketing campaign should target products popular to this demographic to attract them.
- There is also an opportunity to market popular products on sale for the cluster with low annual income but high spending score.

### Portfolio Project 3: Data Cleaning 2 Datasets

**Skills:** Data Cleaning

**Tools:** Python, Pandas

**Code:** 
- CustomerCall_Clean.ipynb
- Hotel_Booking_Demand.ipynb

**Dataset:** 
- Customer_List.xlsx
- Hotel_Booking.csv

**Objective:** Clean up messy call list data for future analysis

**Challenges:** It was difficult to clean and format the phone number as it had lots of different symbols and unique characters. As well as, some number has phone extention that needed to be factored into formula when standardizing format.

**Results:** Cleaned data ready for analysis
